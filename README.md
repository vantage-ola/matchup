# Matchday

Turn-based football strategy on a 22×11 grid. Two teams of 11 take turns moving, passing, and shooting. Possession flips every move. The engine is deterministic — no randomness, pure positional tactics.

## Layout

```
matchup/
├── engine/        # Pure TypeScript game engine (96 tests)
├── simulation/    # AI strategies + AI vs AI runner
└── web/           # React 19 + Vite + shadcn/ui frontend
old/               # Previous prototype — ignore
docs/              # Idea brief, brand guidelines
```

## Commands

```bash
bun matchup/engine/test.ts        # Run engine tests
bun matchup/simulation/run.ts     # AI vs AI simulation
bun --cwd matchup/web dev         # Start web app
```

Use `bun` — not npm/node/npx.

## Game modes

- **1v1 Local Co-op** — two humans, one screen
- **vs AI** — human plays home, `aggressiveStrategy` plays away
